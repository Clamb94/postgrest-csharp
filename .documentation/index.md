Postgrest-csharp is written primarily as a helper library for [supabase/supabase-csharp](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-csharp), however, it should be easy enough to use outside of the supabase ecosystem.

The bulk of this library is a translation and c-sharp-ification of the [supabase/postgrest-js](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js) library.
