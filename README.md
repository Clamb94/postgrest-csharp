Documentation can be found [here](https://supabase-community.github.io/postgrest-csharp/api/Postgrest.html).

Postgrest-csharp is written primarily as a helper library for [supabase/supabase-csharp](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-csharp), however, it should be easy enough to use outside of the supabase ecosystem.

The bulk of this library is a translation and c-sharp-ification of the [supabase/postgrest-js](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js) library.

## Getting Started

Postgrest-csharp is _heavily_ dependent on Models deriving from `BaseModel`. To interact with the API, one must have the associated
model specified.

Leverage `Table`,`PrimaryKey`, and `Column` attributes to specify names of classes/properties that are different from their C# Versions.

```c#
[Table("messages")]
public class Message : BaseModel
{
    [PrimaryKey("id")]
    public int Id { get; set; }

    [Column("username")]
    public string UserName { get; set; }

    [Column("channel_id")]
    public int ChannelId { get; set; }

    public override bool Equals(object obj)
    {
        return obj is Message message &&
                Id == message.Id;
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return HashCode.Combine(Id);
    }
}
```

Utitilizing the client is then just a matter of instantiating it and specifying the Model one is working with.

```c#
void Initialize()
{
    // The default client is a Singleton class that keeps options persisted through an instance
    var client = Client.Initialize("http://localhost:3000");

    // Get All Messages
    var response = await Client.Table<Message>().Get();
    List<Message> models = response.Models;

    // Insert
    var newMessage = new Message { UserName = "acupofjose", ChannelId = 1 };
    await Client.Table<Message>().Insert();

    // Update
    var model = response.Models.First();
    model.UserName = "elrhomariyounes";
    await model.Update();

    // Delete
    await response.Models.Last().Delete();

    // Alternatively, the StatelessClient can be used with Options passed into it.
    var options = new StatelessClientOptions("http://localhost:3000") {};

    var response1 = await StatelessClient.Table<Message>(options).Get();
}
```

## Foreign Keys, Join Tables, and Relationships

The Postgrest server does introspection on relationships between tables and supports returning query data from
tables with these included. **Foreign key constrains are required for postgrest to detect these relationships.**

This library implements the attribute, `Reference` to specify on a model when a relationship should be included in a query.

- [One-to-one Relationships](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#one-to-one-relationships): One-to-one relationships are detected if thereâ€™s an unique constraint on a foreign key.
- [One-to-many Relationships](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#one-to-many-relationships): The inverse one-to-many relationship between two tables is detected based on the foreign key reference.
- [Many-to-many Relationships](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#many-to-many-relationships): Many-to-many relationships are detected based on the join table. The join table must contain foreign keys to other two tables and they must be part of its composite key.

Given the following schema:

![example schema](.github/postgrest-relationship-example.drawio.png)

We can define the following models:

```c#
[Table("movie")]
public class Movie : BaseModel
{
    [PrimaryKey("id", false)]
    public int Id { get; set; }

    [Column("name")]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [Reference(typeof(Person))]
    public List<Person> Persons { get; set; }


    [Column("created_at")]
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
}

[Table("person")]
public class Person : BaseModel
{
    [PrimaryKey("id",false)]
    public int Id { get; set; }

    [Column("first_name")]
    public string FirstName { get; set; }

    [Column("last_name")]
    public string LastName { get; set; }

    [Reference(typeof(Profile))]
    public Profile Profile { get; set; }

    [Column("created_at")]
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
}

[Table("profile")]
public class Profile : BaseModel
{
    [Column("email")]
    public string Email { get; set; }
}
```

**Note that each related model should inherit `BaseModel` and specify its `Table` and `Column` attributes as usual.**

The `Reference` Attribute by default will include the referenced model in all queries on the table (this can be disabled in its constructor).

As such, a query on the `Movie` model (given the above) would return something like:
```js
[
    {
        id: 1,
        created_at: "2022-08-20T00:29:45.400188",
        name: "Top Gun: Maverick",
        person: [
            {
            id: 1,
            created_at: "2022-08-20T00:30:02.120528",
            first_name: "Tom",
            last_name: "Cruise",
            profile: {
                profile_id: 1,
                email: "tom.cruise@supabase.io",
                created_at: "2022-08-20T00:30:33.72443"
                }
            },
            {
                id: 3,
                created_at: "2022-08-20T00:30:33.72443",
                first_name: "Bob",
                last_name: "Saggett",
                profile: {
                    profile_id: 3,
                    email: "bob.saggett@supabase.io",
                    created_at: "2022-08-20T00:30:33.72443"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    // ...
]
```

**Further Notes**:
- Postgrest does not support nested inserts or upserts. Relational keys on models will be ignored when attempting to insert or upsert on a root model.
- The `Relation` attribute uses reflection to only select the attributes specified on the Class Model (i.e. the `Profile` model has a property only for `email`, only the property will be requested in the query).
